# SimpleBilliard
This is a simple Billiard table with onle two balls: Red - the main and White - the second.

I created this repo to give the idea of very simplified physics and billiard game to the beginner who
stared leraning OpenGl (Glut lib).

This is pure C++ written code with Open Graphics library (OpenGL) and FreeGlut Open source Lib.
Please do not mind of critizing the project because I myself a beginner in Graphics. I hope to imrove it.

Have a nice hacking).
