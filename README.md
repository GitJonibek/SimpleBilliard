# SimpleBilliard
This is a simple Billiard table with only two balls: Red - the cue and White - the second.

I created this repo to give the idea of very simplified physics and billiard game to the beginners who
stared leraning OpenGl.

This is a pure C++ written code with Open Graphics library (OpenGL) and FreeGlut Open source Lib.
Please do not mind of critizing the project because I myself a beginner in 2D/3D Graphics programming. I hope to imrove it.

Have a nice hacking).

I recommend to download Short Demo 'Practice Window.mp4' which is a lot smoother.`
